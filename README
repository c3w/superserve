SUPERSERVE v0.1

Generic init.d wrapper.

Got a job/daemon that needs to run at boot time?  You could put it in /etc/crontab as a @reboot
job, but wouldn't you like to have start/stop/restart control?

Enter SuperServe! You can create as many jobs as you'd like, symlink them in init.d to the
superserve script, and superserve, using $0, references the appropriate .inc in /opt/superserve/inc

Usage:
	mkdir -p /opt/superserve/inc
	create a .inc, e.g. job1.inc
		job1.inc reads
			job1&
	symlink into /etc/init.d
		cd /etc/init.d
		ln -s /opt/superserve/superserve job1
		chkconfig job1 add
		chkconfig job1 on
		service job1 restart
